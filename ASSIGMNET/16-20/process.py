Task 16 - 20: Write suitable functions to process the data.

Each of the functions below should follow the pattern:
- Take a list of reviews (where each review is a list of data values) as a parameter.
- Process the list of reviews appropriately.  You may use the module 'tui' to retrieve any additional information 
required from the user to complete the processing.
- Return a suitable result

The required functions are as follows:
- Retrieve the total number of reviews that have been loaded.
- Retrieve the reviews for a hotel where the hotel name is specified by the user.
- Retrieve the reviews for the dates specified by the user.
- Retrieve all the reviews grouped by the reviewerâ€™s nationality.
- Retrieve a summary of all the reviews. This should include the following information for each date in ascending order:
    - the total number of negative reviews on that date
    - the total number of positive reviews on that date
    - the average rating on that date
